## 🧪 Sample Project Highlights

### 🔹 Tokenization & Lemmatization
- Implement tokenization and lemmatization using `spaCy` and `nltk`.

### 🔹 NER & POS Tagging
- Extract named entities and parts of speech from raw text using visualizations.

### 🔹 Sentiment & Review Classification
- Perform binary classification on restaurant and IMDB reviews using traditional ML methods.

### 🔹 Spam Detection
- Use Random Forest to detect spam messages from text data.

### 🔹 Text Summarization
- Build extractive summarization models using basic NLP pipeline.

### 🔹 Capstone Projects
- Real-world case studies applying
